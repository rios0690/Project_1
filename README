Portfolio Project #1: Gazetteer
The first portfolio project, "Gazetteer," involved creating a map-based app to provide information on countries, with a specific focus on a "mobile-first" development approach. The project used the following tech stack:

HTML
CSS
jQuery
PHP
Leafletjs
Bootstrap 5
The solution incorporated PHP server-based components to fetch data from third-party APIs such as Geonames and OpenWeather.
